# GlassCart

GlassCart bridges the gap between physical and digital commerce. It enables instant, app-free purchases from physical ads (billboards, posters, shop windows) using QR codes and short links, and provides real-time analytics for advertisers and retailers.

## Features
- Omnichannel activation: QR codes, short links, and more
- Frictionless, app-free checkout (mobile-first)
- Real-time analytics and campaign performance
- Dynamic content and inventory-driven messaging
- Unified backend for multi-channel campaigns

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the `glasscart` directory, you can run:

- `npm start` — Runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm test` — Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` — Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` — Ejects the app (not reversible)
